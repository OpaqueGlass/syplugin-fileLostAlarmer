After synchronization, call API to check whether there is missing resource file in the latest snapshot, and if there is, remind the user;

> [!WARNING]
> The plugin checks through the Siyuan snapshot comparison API, only for automated execution of comparisons and prompting for file deletions, without separately implementing file snapshots or file status recording. 
> 
> If the Siyuan built-in synchronization is not used, synchronization conditions cannot be checked. If snapshot information is abnormal or delayed, synchronization deletion situations cannot be discovered either. 
> 
> The plugin is also unable to detect cases where old files overwrite new files. The results of the comparison are for reference only.
